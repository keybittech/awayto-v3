## Background 

The intent of this software is to provide a generic platform that organizations can use to offer online collaborative services to their members. The system is highly configurable and allows for the hosting of a wide range of businesses and organizations. Multi-modal communications (i.e. docs, chat/video) are central to the system, taking after the design of an online writing center.

Site creator, Joe McCormick, worked at the Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) Writing Center as a professional writing tutor and volunteer web developer, under the supervision of Writing Center director Clinton Gardner. There, they created an online tutoring platorm which allowed users to meet together in a live, online space using voice, video, and text. This platform has facilitated tens of thousands of meetings with students at the school.
