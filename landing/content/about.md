## Background 

Site creator, Joe McCormick, worked at the Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) Writing Center as a professional writing tutor and volunteer web developer, under the supervision of Writing Center Director Clint Gardner. Together they created an online tutoring platorm which allowed users to meet on a live, online space using voice, video, and text. This platform has facilitated tens of thousands of meetings with students at the school.

Joe went on to receive a Masters from Durham University, England, in TESOL with a focus on Applied Language Studies. For his dissertation, he surveyed and studied writing centers and their ability to perform needs analysis on their tutees. Afterward, he worked as tech leader and director in various software development roles.

The intent of this software is to provide a generic platform that organizations can use to offer online collaborative services to their members. The system is highly configurable and allows for the hosting of a wide range of businesses and organizations. Multi-modal communications (i.e. docs, chat/video) are central to the system.
