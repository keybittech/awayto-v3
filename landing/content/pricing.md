## Always Open 

> Single-person groups are completely free

Anyone can join the platform for free and create their own 1-person group, along with the necessary services, schedules, etc, and meet with their own users.

## Seat

> $5 per schedule-user per month

Multi-person groups are priced by **Seat**, based on users who have a Role with the Scheduling ability, at a rate of $5 per user per month. All groups start with 5 complimentary **Seats**.

- **Seats** can be purchased on the Group Users page.

- Roles are assigned to Users on the Group Users page.

- The Scheduling ability can be assigned to a Role on the Role Matrix page.

#### Example: With 10 Staff and any number of Members, the group's monthly cost is $50.

- The group leader creates two roles during onboarding: Member and Staff. Member is the default role.

- On the Role Matrix page, the leader assigns the Scheduling ability to the Staff role, and the Request ability to the Member role.

- New group members are Members by default. The leader re-assigns staff who join to the Staff role, manually, on the Group Users page.

- Only Roles with the Scheduling ability will be considered when deducting a **Seat**.

- When the platform sees that a user with the Staff role has logged in at least once in the current month, the group **Seat** count will be reduced by 1.
