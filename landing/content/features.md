## Groups

Awayto allows groups to offer services to their users. For example, a writing center offering writing tutoring to students at a college or university; or a telehealth group which offers virtual support to their patients. Groups can be restricted to users from specific email domains, or remain available to join by anyone, as long as they have the group code. 

## Roles 

Upon creating your group, you will define some basic roles for your users, and the default role that any user will receive upon joining your group. Roles are used to limit functionality across the site and can be assigned in a fine-grained way. Roles are assigned to users, and permissions are assigned to the roles. All of the features described on this page, as well as roles themselves, can be managed by users holding the appropriate permissions. Certain permissions are limited to the group admin and may not be conferred to a role; creating the group with an administrative email is a good practice.

## Services

Services describe the work performed or offered by your group, to your users. Services can contain Tiers, offering varying levels of service. Tiers are open-ended and can cover different contexts, ex: "silver, gold, platinum" versus "Eng 1010, Eng 1020, Eng 2010, Eng 2020". For example, a tutoring group might have different types of tutoring offered as services, while the Tiers within allow students to specify the class they want to focus on during the session. Services are also where Forms are utilized, allowing session participants to be surveyed, before of after the session.

## Scheduling

At a top level, group managers create a master schedule. Then, users with Scheduling permissions may create personal schedules based on the master. Schedules have a start and end time, as well as a description of the time divisions expected for that schedule. For example, a weekly schedule which has time slots of 30 minutes shows a grid of 7 days (columns) with 30 minute increments (rows) where appointments can be scheduled across 24 hours of each day. This module is highly customizable and supports schedules of all varieties: daily, weekly, monthly divisions which can be subdivided by minutes, hours, and days, where applicable.

## Voice-Video Conferencing

A conferencing platform is offered at the time of the scheduled appointment. During the conference users can chat via text, audio, and video, as well as share documents and draw on a real-time collaborative canvas. After the meeting, users can see a summary, rate the appointment, and complete any surveys. Group meetings are supported, as long as all participants request an appointment from the same staff member, and that staff member approves the request in a batch.
