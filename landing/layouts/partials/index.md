## What is Awayto?

Awayto is for groups or organizations which require scheduling, communications, reporting, and related functionality. Collaborative multi-modal features (voice/video/chat/docs) are positioned within a robust collection of operations-driven functionality (users/groups/roles/services/scheduling/surveying/reporting). Many founding principles of the platform were derived from previous experience developing and extending an online writing center. However, Awayto is built to be generic-purpose and enable the development of any kind of online platform with multi-modal needs.

## Features

### Groups

The application is a platform for groups to offer services to their users. For example, a writing center offering writing tutoring to students at a college or university; or a telehealth group which offers virtual support to their patients. Groups can be restricted to users from specific email domains, or remain available to join by anyone, as long as they have the group code. 

### Roles 

Upon creating your group, you will define some basic roles for your users, and the default role that any user will receive upon joining your group. Roles are used to limit functionality across the site and can be assigned in a fine-grained way. Roles are assigned to users, and sets of functionality are assigned to the roles. All of the features described on this page, as well as roles themselves, can be managed by the roles you assign to your users.

### Services

The services of your group are what work will be performed or offered by your group to your users. Each service can be described by one or more tiers of service. The system allows for fluid configuration of a range of services and can be used to offer varying levels of services with different or shared features. The varying levels are open-ended and can cover different contexts, ex: "silver, gold, platinum" versus "Eng 1010, Eng 1020, Eng 2010, Eng 2020". So for example a writing center group could have a Writing Tutoring service which students could specify the coursework they want to focus on. Furthermore, a form designer allows for the collection of any specific info necessary before the appointment, as well as surveying of users after the appointment.

### Scheduling

At a top level, group managers create a master schedule. Then, users create personal schedules based on the master. Schedules have a start and end time, as well as a description of the time divisions expected for that schedule. For example, a weekly schedule which has time slots of 30 minutes shows a grid of 7 days (columns) with 30 minute increments (rows) where appointments can be scheduled across 24 hours of each day. This module is highly customizable and supports schedules of all varieties. Daily, weekly, monthly divisions which can be subdivided by minutes, hours, and days, where applicable.

### Voice-Video Conferencing

To facilitate the services offered by your group, a conferencing platform is offered at the time of the scheduled appointment. During the conference users can chat via text, audio, and video, as well as share documents and draw on a real-time collaborative canvas. After the meeting, users can see a summary, rate the appointment, and complete any surveys. Any number of your users may participate in a single meeting, as long as they all schedule it together with the same staff member.
