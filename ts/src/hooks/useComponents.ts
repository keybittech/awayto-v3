/**
 * `useComponents` is a React custom hook that takes advantage of [React.lazy](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) as well as the [Proxy API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy). By combining these functionalities, `useComponents` becomes an efficient tool that smoothly integrates with codebases that are regularly changing or expanding.
 * 
 * The `useComponents` hook searches for newly added files in the project and makes them easily accessible through the tool.
 * 
 * This feature is designed to work seamlessly with React's code splitting features, which provide additional performance improvements in terms of bundling and code delivery to the user. `useComponents` will not provide access to a component until it's required, reducing initial page load times and improving site interactivity.
 * 
 * ```
 * import { useComponents } from 'awayto/hooks';
 * 
 * const { NewDevelopmentComponent } = useComponents();
 * 
 * render <NewDevelopmentComponent {...props} />;
 * ```
 *
 * When `useComponents` is called, it first uses the `useParams` hook to identify the current URL's group name. Once obtained, `useComponents` lazily loads the various components in the project and makes them available for rendering. 
 *
 * `useComponents` also checks whether a user has access to render a component, based on their group membership and available roles. If a user does not have the correct group membership or role, then the component is not returned and is replaced with a blank <div> element. 
 * 
 * Each component has a corresponding path with roles linked to it that are maintained in `roles.json`. These roles represent the permissions required to access and render a given component. These roles can be expanded on with "export const roles = [....];" in a file that should be restricted.
